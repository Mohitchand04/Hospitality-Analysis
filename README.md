## Problem Statement
Atliq Grands, a well-established luxury hotel chain in India, has been in operation for the past 20 years. Due to competitive strategic moves and inefficient decision-making, they are experiencing a decline in market share and revenue. To address this, Atliq Grands plans to integrate “Business and Data Intelligence” to make more informed decisions and regain their foothold in the market. 

Without an in-house analytics team, they have engaged a third-party data analytics provider to analyze their historical data and provide insights.

## Task List
As a Data Analyst, the following tasks were completed:

1. **Metrics Creation**: Generated key metrics according to the provided metric list.
2. **Dashboard Development**: Built an interactive dashboard following the stakeholder’s mock-up.
3. **Additional Insights**: Developed additional insights not listed in the mock-up/dashboard to provide more actionable recommendations.

## Key Learnings
- **Custom Visuals**: Developed a calendar visual using a matrix table, which can be reused for analyzing various scenarios.
- **Cancellation Policy Insights**: Discovered that most hotels charge no cancellation fee if booking is canceled 3 months prior. Post that, cancellation charges range from 60% to 90% of the booking cost.
- **Bookmarks and Selections**: Learned how to utilize bookmarks and selection panes for page navigation and clearing filters in the dashboard.
- **Consistent Design**: Used a consistent color palette across the dashboard for improved visualization and user experience.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard
- **Top Cities by Revenue**: 
  - Mumbai generated the highest revenue at ₹669M, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.
- **Top-Performing Property**: 
  - *AtliQ Exotica* outperformed other properties with ₹320M in revenue, an occupancy rate of 57%, and a cancellation rate of 24.4%.
- **Occupancy Leaders**:

- **Revenue Peaks**: 
  - Week 24 recorded the highest revenue at ₹139.6M.

## Conclusion
